abstract: 'N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is an important mechanism in miRNA processing and maturation, but the role of its aberrant regulation in human diseases remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that oncogenic primary microRNA-25 (miR-25) in pancreatic duct epithelial cells can be excessively maturated by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) via enhanced m6A modification that is mediated by NF-ÎºB associated protein (NKAP). This modification is catalyzed by overexpressed methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) due to hypomethylation of the METTL3 promoter also caused by CSC. Mature miR-25, miR-25-3p, suppresses PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2), resulting in the activation of oncogenic AKT-p70S6K signaling, which provokes malignant phenotypes of pancreatic cancer cells. High levels of miR-25-3p are detected in smokers and in pancreatic cancers tissues that are correlated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. These results collectively indicate that cigarette smoke-induced miR-25-3p excessive maturation via m6A modification promotes the development and progression of pancreatic cancer.'
