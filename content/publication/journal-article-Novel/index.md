abstract: 'The therapeutic strategies of stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after curative surgery remain controversial. In the clinical decision-making process, oncologists need to answer questions such as whether adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary or which therapeutic regimen should be given to each patient. At present, whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be applied is primarily based on histopathological features and clinical risk factors. However, only a fraction of patients can benefit from it. More rigorous stratifying biomarkers are urgently needed to help further distinguishing these populations of patients. Recent progress in next-generation sequencing and high-throughput technologies has greatly promoted biomarker discovery as well as our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in CRC. Novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers that are associated with prognosis or therapeutic responses have emerged. In this review, we discuss the strategies of biomarker discovery and summarize the status and assess the utility of previously published biomarkers in CRC.'
