abstract: "Rationale: STING is a critical player in the innate and adaptive immune system, sensing cytosolic DNA to activate the expression of interferon genes and regulate T lymphocytes, which drives immunogenic responses to cancer cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), abundantly present in the tumor microenvironment, play a key role in cancer development. Gastric cancer is one of the most common and leading causes in cancer-related death worldwide. However, studies on the function and regulation of STING in TAMs and their roles in gastric cancer progression are still limited."
