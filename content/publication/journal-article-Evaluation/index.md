abstract: 'Immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, including antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or cytotoxic T-lymphocyteâ€“associated protein 4 (CTLA4), has demonstrated impressive clinical efficacy in controlling advanced cancers. Recent studies have identified several positive predictive markers for ICI, including high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-high), PD-L1 overexpression, and elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB).1 The genes that encode DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) and delta 1 (POLD1) are essential for proofreading and fidelity in DNA replication.2 Their germline or somatic mutations can lead to DNA-repair deficiencies and carcinogenesis via a DNA hypermutated molecular phenotype.3,4 An association between POLE or POLD1 mutations and clinical benefit to ICI has been observed in several case reports.5,6 However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of POLE or POLD1 mutation frequency and their predictive value for ICI treatment outcome has not yet been reported. In this study, we conducted a combined analysis using a large data set and found that POLE/POLD1 mutations are promising potential predictive biomarkers for positive ICI outcomes.'
